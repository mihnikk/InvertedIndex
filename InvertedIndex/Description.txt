Simple full-text index solution, created for educational purpose.
Goals:
- learn algorithms and data structures in a tree example
- learn C++ serialization of complex objects
- practical example of low level network programming
- practical application of OrientDB

Roadmap:
- 0.1: index in memory, searching in one file
- 0.2: storing index in separate file, reading from it (add file to index)
- 0.3: storing index in OrientDB graph database
